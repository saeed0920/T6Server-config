To configure your server:

1. Open the configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano /opt/T6Server/Plutonium/T6Server.sh
   ```

2. Modify the variables according to your preferences. For example:
   ```bash
   readonly SERVER_NAME="My Awesome T6 Server" # The name of your server
   readonly SERVER_KEY="your_server_key" # Key provided by Plutonium
   readonly SERVER_PORT=4976 # Default port for T6 servers
   readonly GAME_MODE="t6mp" # "t6mp" for Multiplayer, "t6zm" for Zombies
   readonly MOD="mods/weapons" # MOD path
   readonly ADDITIONAL_PARAMS="" # Additional parameters for the server
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor by pressing `Ctrl+x`, then `Y` to confirm, and Enter to save.

Note: For Zombie mode, set `GAME_PATH` to "/opt/T6Server/Server/Zombie", `CONFIG_FILE` to "dedicated_zm.cfg", and `GAME_MODE` to "t6zm". Also, set the `MOD` variable to the path of the Zombie mode MOD.

Ensure all settings are correctly configured before launching your server.

### Default Ports
- T6 (Black Ops II): 21889 (UDP)
### Directory Structure

| Directory | Path | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Mods** | `/opt/T6Server/Plutonium/storage/t6/mods/` | Custom game modifications |
| **Config - Multiplayer** | `/opt/T6Server/Server/Multiplayer/main/configs/` | Multiplayer configuration files |
| **Config - Zombie** | `/opt/T6Server/Server/Zombie/main/configs/` | Zombie mode configuration files |
| **Logs** | `/opt/T6Server/Plutonium/storage/t6/logs/` | Server log files |
| **Stats** | `/opt/T6Server/Plutonium/storage/t6/stats/` | Player statistics |
| **Playlists** | `/opt/T6Server/Plutonium/storage/t6/playlists/` | Custom game playlists |
| **Game Settings** | `/opt/T6Server/Plutonium/storage/t6/gamesettings/` | Game mode settings |
| **Player Data** | `/opt/T6Server/Plutonium/storage/t6/players/` | Player-specific data |
| **Scripts** | `/opt/T6Server/Plutonium/storage/t6/scripts/` | Custom game scripts |
| **Maps - Multiplayer** | `/opt/T6Server/Server/Multiplayer/usermaps/` | Custom multiplayer maps |
| **Maps - Zombie** | `/opt/T6Server/Server/Zombie/usermaps/` | Custom zombie maps |

To change maps:
1. Edit the appropriate configuration file:
   - Multiplayer: `/opt/T6Server/Server/Multiplayer/main/dedicated.cfg`
   - Zombie: `/opt/T6Server/Server/Zombie/main/dedicated_zm.cfg`

### File Organization
For proper server organization, place files in these specific directories:

#### Custom Mods
1. Place mod files in `/opt/T6Server/Plutonium/storage/t6/mods/`
2. Enable mods by adding to server config:
   ```cfg
   set sv_enablemods "1"
   set fs_game "mods/mod_name"
   ```

#### Custom Maps
1. Place custom map files in their respective directories:
   - Multiplayer maps: `/opt/T6Server/Server/Multiplayer/usermaps/`
   - Zombie maps: `/opt/T6Server/Server/Zombie/usermaps/`

2. Load custom maps by adding them to the map rotation in the config files:
   ```cfg
   // For Multiplayer (in dedicated.cfg)
   sv_maprotation "map usermaps/custom_map_name map mp_nuketown_2020"
   sv_maprotationcurrent ""
   
   // For Zombies (in dedicated_zm.cfg) 
   sv_maprotation "map usermaps/custom_zombie_map"
   sv_maprotationcurrent ""
   ```

3. Map file organization:
   - Map files (.ff extension) go directly in the usermaps folder
   - Supporting files like textures and models should be in a subfolder with the same name as the map
   - Example structure:
     ```
     usermaps/
     ├── custom_map.ff
     └── custom_map/
         ├── textures/
         ├── models/
         └── other assets/
     ```

4. Important notes:
   - Maps must be in the correct format (.ff files)
   - File permissions should be set to allow server read access
   - Map names in rotation must exactly match the filename (without .ff)
   - Restart server after adding new maps


## Launching the Server

To launch your Plutonium Call of Duty: Black Ops II server, follow these professional steps:

1. Navigate to the T6Server installation directory:
   ```bash
   cd /opt/T6Server/Plutonium
   ```

2. Ensure the start script has the necessary execution permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x T6Server.sh
   ```

3. Launch the server:
   ```bash
   ./T6Server.sh
   ```

For advanced server management:
- To run multiple servers concurrently, utilize terminal multiplexers such as `tmux` or `screen`.
- For background operation, you can use the `nohup` command:
  ```bash
  nohup ./T6Server.sh > server.log 2>&1 &
  ```
  This will run the server in the background, redirecting output to `server.log`.

Note: Ensure all necessary configurations in `server.cfg` and other relevant files are properly set before launching the server.

## Troubleshooting

This section provides solutions to common issues you may encounter while setting up and running your Plutonium Call of Duty: Black Ops II server. Follow these detailed steps to resolve problems efficiently.

### Wine Display Errors

**Issue**: You may see error messages related to Wine display when starting the server.

**Solution**: These errors are not critical and can be safely ignored. The Plutonium server operates as a console application and does not require graphical support. Your server will function correctly despite these messages.

**Note for debugging**: By default, Wine errors are hidden. If you need to debug Wine-related issues, you can remove the `2>/dev/null` at the end of the server start command in `T6Server.sh`. This will allow Wine errors to be displayed, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.

### Unable to Load Import from binkw32.dll

**Issue**: An error occurs when the server attempts to load binkw32.dll.

**Solution**: 
1. Verify the `PAT` variable in `T6Server.sh`:
   - Open the file: `nano /opt/T6Server/T6Server.sh`
   - Ensure the `PAT` variable is correctly set to your server's path, pointing to the directory containing binkw32.dll:
     - For Multiplayer: `/opt/T6Server/Server/Multiplayer`
     - For Zombie mode: `/opt/T6Server/Server/Zombie`
2. Correct file permissions:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/T6Server
   ```
3. If the issue persists, try reinstalling the game binaries using the installation script.

### Server Not Appearing in Plutonium Server List

**Issue**: Your server is running but not visible to players in the Plutonium server list.

**Solution**:
1. Verify port accessibility:
   - Ensure the server port (default: 4976) is open for UDP traffic
   - Use a port checking tool to confirm the port is reachable from the internet
2. Configure your firewall:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 4976/udp comment "Plutonium-Server"
   sudo ufw reload
   ```
3. If behind a NAT:
   - Configure port forwarding on your router
   - Forward UDP port 4976 to your server's local IP address
4. Verify server configuration:
   - Check `server.cfg` for correct settings
   - Ensure `sv_lanOnly` is set to 0

### Authentication Issues

**Issue**: You encounter authentication errors when starting the server.

**Solution**:
1. Verify your Plutonium key:
   - Log in to your Plutonium account at https://platform.plutonium.pw/serverkeys
   - Confirm your key is valid and not expired
2. Check key placement:
   - Open `T6Server.sh`
   - Ensure the `SERVER_KEY` variable contains your correct key
3. If issues persist:
   - Reinstall game binaries using the installation script
   - Update Plutonium to the latest version
